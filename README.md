# Description
The Social Network API is a backend application for a social network web app. It uses MongoDB and Mongoose to handle large amounts of unstructured data, allowing users to share thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and manage their friend lists.

This API demonstrates the implementation of CRUD operations for users, thoughts, reactions, and friendships, with a focus on backend development.
